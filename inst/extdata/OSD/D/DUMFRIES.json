Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  They developed in old, very gravelly alluvium.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Appling, Augusta, Cecil, Hiwassee, Masada, Roanoke and Turbeville soils.
